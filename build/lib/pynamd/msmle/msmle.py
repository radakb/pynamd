    Arguments
    ---------
    reduced_potentials : array-like
        Either 2 or 3d array-like reduced energies. 2d data is assumed to be
        sorted by state in stacked blocks with the first axis indicating which
        state the energy is evaluated in and the second axis is the sample
        index. Alternatively, 3d data sorts both state indices on separate
        axes. That is, the first axis is which state the data was drawn from,
        the second is which state it is evaluated in, and the third is the
        sample index within the given state. Note that, for unevenly sampled
        states there may be zero padding.

    nsamples : array-like
        1d array-like sample counts from each state (may be zero). These
        indicate how reduced_potentials is stacked (i.e. the block size for
        2d data and where zero padding begins for 3d data).

          Arrange the data in the "flattened" sample space suggested in Ref 1.
        This is essentially a matrix where each element on the first axis is a
        data point with the potential evaluated in each state. No reference is
        made to where each point was sampled from. The advantage of this is
        that the resulting array is 2D, not 3D (as in pymbar), and requires no
        masking procedures.
          The energies are sorted into two arrays - one for the sampled states
        (_u_nj_m) and one for the unsampled states (_u_nj_k). This (admittedly
        opaque) notation derives from the notation in Ref 1 whereby m sampled
        states and k unsampled states are considered. In any event this
        separation of data greatly simplifies calculation of the objective
